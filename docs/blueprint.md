## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant cyan (#34E9EF), inspired by the concepts of energy and modernity, should draw attention without overwhelming the user.
- Background color: Very dark grayish-blue (#0C101A), providing a strong contrast that makes the vibrant primary color stand out, in a dark scheme.
- Accent color: Purple (#B174FF), which is analogous to cyan, and will highlight calls to action and important information.
- Font: 'Montserrat' sans-serif, which is already prescribed in the request and will be used for headlines and body text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Ensure a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on all devices.
- Implement subtle animations for UI elements to enhance user experience and provide visual feedback.
- Use minimalist icons in a bright style, aligning with the overall design aesthetic.
